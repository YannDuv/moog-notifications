_Front-end developer task: Notifications_

### 👀 Overview

The goal for this task is to create a simple Notifications interface.
The attached invitations.json file contains information about some events users should be notified about. Create a single page application that, based on the provided data, displays an overview of current notifications, showing the information on each of them and including read/unread status display.
After a fixed amount of time, the invitations_update.json file needs to be loaded and the new information included there should be reflected in the UI.
This is an open-ended task with no specific design, where the choices regarding presentation and user interaction are left to the developer.

### 💻 Technologies

You can use any framework or library of your choice. You can use transpilers and preprocessors if preferred.
The result is expected to be a package containing HTML, CSS, JS and any pre-compiled sources. Ideally the package will include a built version of the application that requires no building steps to run.
The resulting application shouldn’t require any server side code (JAVA, PHP, nodeJS, etc).
Outcomes
Upon submitting the code we’ll be looking at the overall result of your work, including but not limited to:

- Ensuring the code executes and the displayed data is accurate
- The presentation and user experience
- Clarity and consistency of the code
- Coding patterns and best practices
- Technologies used
